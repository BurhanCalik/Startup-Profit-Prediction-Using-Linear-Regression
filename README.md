# Startup Profit Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts the profit of startups based on expenditures in R&D, Administration, and Marketing. The linear regression model is developed using Pythonâ€™s `scikit-learn` library, providing insight into the impact of these factors on profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **R&D Spend**: Investment in research and development.
- **Administration**: Administrative costs.
- **Marketing Spend**: Marketing and promotional expenses.
- **Profit**: Target variable representing the profit of the startup.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and explore the dataset using `pandas`.
2. **Feature Selection**: Use R&D, Administration, and Marketing columns as features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
